# waveform
i made a highly specific thing for my awesome brother.

hey kiddo,

run WaveformGenerator.bat and it should do what you want.
there's some error cases that aren't handled very gracefully yet but this should do most of what you need.
i'll keep working on it and post updates here.
i'll also add a better readme someday, probably.
hit me up if something is confusing or doesn't work.
good luck with all the science! you rock.
